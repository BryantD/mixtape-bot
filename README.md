Bot script to generate five song mix tapes based on the Billboard Top 100 for a 
given year. By default, it draws on the 1980s. 

Currently sending output to [https://botsin.space/@scratchytdk](https://botsin.space/@scratchytdk). Twitter is waiting on approval of my developer application. 

To do:
* Twitter posts
* Spotify?
